# SnapDo
<i>Destroy your computer</i>

## What is this?
Don't worry, it isn't actually Snap.do! The purpose of this repo is to create the least optimized, least efficient, and most pointless program ever. It started out as a simple function that does absolutely nothing but call itself recursively the input factorial times. But where will it go from here? Forks? Multithreading? Maybe eventually even an impossible to navigate GUI! Who knows? Just add something to it to make it worse.
